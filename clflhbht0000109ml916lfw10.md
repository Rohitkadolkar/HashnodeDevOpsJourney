### **On Day 5, trying to write shell scripts that are actively used by DevOps engineers. Will create a series of directories at once and also take backup of data in a particular file.**

1. ### Write a bash script [createDirectories.sh](http://createDirectories.sh) that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.
