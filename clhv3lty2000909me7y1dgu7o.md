One of the most important parts of your DevOps and CICD journey is a Declarative Pipeline Syntax of Jenkins

## Some terms for your Knowledge

**What is Pipeline -** A pipeline is a collection of steps or jobs interlinked in a sequence.

**Declarative:** Declarative is a more recent and advanced implementation of a pipeline as a code.

**Scripted:** Scripted was the first and most traditional implementation of the pipeline as a code in Jenkins. It was designed as a general-purpose DSL (Domain Specific Language) built with Groovy.

# Why you should have a Pipeline

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a [`Jenkinsfile`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile)) which in turn can be committed to a projectâ€™s source control repository.  
This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-code"; treating the CD pipeline as a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like any other code.

**Creating a** `Jenkinsfile` and committing it to source control provides a number of immediate benefits:

* Automatically creates a Pipeline build process for all branches and pull requests.
    
* Code review/iteration on the Pipeline (along with the remaining source code).
    

# Pipeline syntax

```yaml
pipeline {
    agent any 
    stages {
        stage('Build') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Pre-steps

First go to

Jenkins dashboard

Select Manage Jenkins

Under security, select **Manage credentials**

In System global add credentials for Docker so that we can push and pull images from docker-hub by logging in.

Also add Webhook to GitHub repository

Go to the repository&gt;Settings&gt;Webhook(left pane)

## Steps to build pipeline

Go to New item on dashboard

Give a name (My-First-Pipeline)

Give description

Check Github Project and enter url

Under build triggers, select **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**

Enter pipeline script as follows -

Now go to the pipeline from dashboard and run build now

It will show build stepwise

## Webhook

Suppose you make some changes in your Github code, You do not need to build again manually.

Using webhook, a build will immediately be triggered as soon as a push is made on the master branch.

Now lets make some changes on the Github code.

As soon as I make some changes, a build will automatically be triggered as shown below.
